# GitHub Repositories With Search Functionality Challenge

## Description

The project is a GitHub profile page clone. It displays a user's list of repositories and allows to search for repositories by name. 

You can checkout the project here: https://radiant-cendol-9d9adb.netlify.app/


## How to run the project
After cloning the project, create a GitHub personal access token and add it to an .env file (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). Then, run:

### `npm install` to install all dependencies

### `npm start` to run the project.

You can then go to `localhost:3000` where you will find the landing page.
You can then go ahead and search for a user's repositories by typing their username (not the full name), or by going to `localhost:3000/{username}/repos`.


## Future improvements

The project is open to improvements and added features such as:

* Completing the implementation of pagination
* Filtering by language and type
* Handlling incorrect URLs typed in
* Changing date format shown on repository
* Changing number format (e.g. 1000 => 1k)
* Adding Loading page

For the development of the project, we can continute working on:
* Implementing tests
* Using GraphQL for fetching data
* Adding Storybook

## Feedback

The exercise was fun to work on and allowed me to learn a lot and work on a project from every aspect. I will definitely be continuing to work on it to complete all the tasks because I'm intrigued to tackle the improvements discussed above.
